# Marvel-Snap-Collection-Tools
This is a small Python application that uses your locally saved Marvel Snap data to help you figure out which cards you're closest to Mastery on, and how many boosters you have for them. You can also see how many variants you have for specific cards, and how close you are to completion for various variant albums.
